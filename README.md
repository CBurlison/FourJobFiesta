When rolling a job as long as you have a crystal and Run Type selected, a job will be selected and displayed.

Right clicking on the job display areas will allow you to manually select a job for that crystal.

Saving your current configuration will save your selected crystal, run type, modifier and jobs to a CSV. Saving or loading a configuration will cause that configuration to be loaded upon launching the application.
